## Project Workflow

**Exceeds Expectations**

Great job with the planning process! Nice wirefames, and user stories are clear, and accomplishable!  Would be really cool to see more commentary in your `readme` about your process, things you would like to implemnt! Also, please include set-up instructions for this application.

## Technical Requirements

**Meets Expectations**

Nice job implementing user authentication, and locking down your app's authorization with CanCanCan!
Demonstrates utilizing nested resources, and at least two models of CRUD.

## Creativity / Interface

**Exceeds Expectations**

Really enjoyed your approach with the visual design, and your creativity was evident in your CSS and layout!
Loved how most of the app's action occurs on the index page, would like to see you eventually turn this into a Single Page app via partials and/or front-end JS/ajax in the future!

## Deployment and Functionality

**Meets Expectations**

Great job hitting your MVP, app is functional, and deployed, though currently I think there might be an issue with the latest version last time I checked. Would like to see you challenge yourself to come back to this an tackle your gold user stories! Make sure to put the link to the deployed url in your repo.
